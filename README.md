# Name: 
  Temoc's Insurance and Financial Adventure
# Description: 
  Go on an adventure with your favorite UT Dallas mascots to learn more about Insurance and Financial Planning. 
  
# Purpose: 
  Teaching personal finance and insurance to UTD's college students and bring them to State Farm as customers (expanding target market).

# Sponsor Challenges:
 **State Farm:**
    State Farm’s 100-year anniversary is in 2022. Over the years we have continued to add products to better help our customers. Your challenge is to identify and build out a new tech product or service State Farm could provide to its customers as a “value add”. While State Farm is primarily in the insurance and financial services industry, do not feel limited to those product lines.

    **UTD Student Government Challenge:**
    Build for UT Dallas Students: Build an app (either mobile or web) that makes UTD Student life better. This challenge will be judged by the Office of Information Technology, with prizes being awarded to UTD students only.
